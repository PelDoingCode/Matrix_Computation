# Matrix_Computation

<h2> Computer Science project in C on Matrixs </h2>	

Little project in C (a lot of pointers used!) about matrix (dynamic allocation and computation of matrixs using terminal input in Linux)

During this project I have learnt few things : 

<p> The use of message in terminal etc </p>
<p> Generation of random numbers </p>
<p> Generation of random matrixs </p>
<p> Read and write a matrix in a file </p>
--> Read matrixs and comment from a file
--> Dynamic allocation of matrixs
--> Computation of matrix (transposition, basic operations...)
--> Display a matrix in a terminal
And so more....
