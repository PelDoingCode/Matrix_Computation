# Matrix_Computation

Little project in C (a lot of pointers used!) about matrix (dynamic allocation and computation of matrixs using terminal input in Linux)

During this project I have learnt few things : 

--> The use of message in terminal etc
--> Generation of random numbers
--> Generation of random matrixs
--> Read and write a matrix in a file
--> Read matrixs and comment from a file
--> Dynamic allocation of matrixs
--> Computation of matrix (transposition, basic operations...)
--> Display a matrix in a terminal
And so more....
